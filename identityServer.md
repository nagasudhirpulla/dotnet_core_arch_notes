### Why Identity Server
* Identity Server is a **Secure Token Service (STS)** that issues tokens for authenticating users or apps across applications
* This way the security concerns of api interactions and user interactions with apps are addressed by a single identity server
* This is just like "sign once with google to access all apps like gmail, drive, youtube"
* This is very useful for securing apps or users in a group of microservices operating in an ecosytem
* Identity server issues security tokens based on **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect** standards

### How it works
